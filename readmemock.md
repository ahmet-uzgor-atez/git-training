# Hello, I'm Hüseyin Okumuş

Hi there! Welcome to this mock Git training session, where I promise we’ll keep things informative and slightly entertaining. 

## About Me
I’m Hüseyin Okumuş, a software developer who’s as passionate about clean code as I am about watching Galatasaray win (which, let’s be honest, is the ultimate joy). If there’s one thing I’ve mastered other than programming, it’s refreshing my football app for updates on match day.

## Fun Facts
- **Version Control Expert**: Just like Git, I never forget things — especially if it’s a bad referee decision during a Galatasaray game.
- **Commit Messages**: Mine are usually more dramatic than the last-minute goals in a derby. Expect lines like “Fixed it... or did I?” or “Refactored everything... because why not?”.
- **Branching**: I have more branches than a busy Sunday at a Turkish coffee shop. My strategy is simple: always work on a branch named after the biggest game coming up that week.

## Why Git Matters to Me
Version control is like a good defense strategy in football: it saves you from a complete disaster (most of the time). So, if you’re here to learn Git, I hope my jokes don’t branch out too far from the main topic. 

Let’s commit to learning together!
